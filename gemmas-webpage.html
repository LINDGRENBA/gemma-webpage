  <h1>Gemma's Webpage</h1>
  <h2>Written by Brittany Lindgren</h2>

  <p>This page is a tribute to my adorable dog Gemma. Gemma is a rescue and likes to spend her day staring out the window at the neighborhood cats, barking at the dogs on the other side of our fence in the backyard and making uncomfortable eye contact with us in an attempt to procure food.</p>

  <p>The following is a list of Gemma's <em>current</em> favorite toys:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mr. Snake</li>
    <li>Mr. Shark</li>
    <li>Mr. Bear</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As you can see, there is a naming theme.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to read more about Gemma, you can go to this <a href="">Gemma Web Page</a> I made about her earlier.</p>
